Characters/GovernmentWorker (govtWorkerThumbnail): Ah, comrade, welcome to our glorious capitol! I bet you've never seen anything like it, eh? Capitol City is the envy of the world!
Characters/GovernmentWorker (govtWorkerThumbnail): I am sure the Minister of Energy will be happy to hear you have arrived. His last errand boy was sent to gulag for spilling coffee, haha!
player (playerThumbnail): Wait, what do you mean errand boy? The job description said Executive Assistant.
Characters/GovernmentWorker (govtWorkerThumbnail): Oh, yes, of course, of course! That's what I meant. Now, you'd better run along. You wouldn't want to be late to your first day of work! Head north until you find the capitol building.
